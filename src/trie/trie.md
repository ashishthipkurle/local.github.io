# Trie

A trie, also known as a prefix tree or digital tree, is a specialized tree-like data structure designed for efficient storage and retrieval of strings. It's particularly well-suited for scenarios where searching, inserting, and deleting strings based on their prefixes is a primary operation.

The fundamental idea behind a trie is that each node represents a possible character in a string. The edges emanating from a node correspond to the different characters that can follow that character. This structure allows for rapid traversal and search based on prefixes.

Tries are commonly used in applications such as autocomplete, spell checking, and searching for words with similar prefixes.

## Operations

1. Insertion: Insert a new string into the trie.
2. Search: Search for a string in the trie.
3. Deletion: Delete a string from the trie.
