# Complexity

Complexity is the process of comparing minimum 2 algorithms with respect to space and time. 

An algorithm is said to be efficient and fast, if it takes to execute and consumes less memory space.

## Types of complexity

There are six types of complexity :-

1. Constant Complexity. [O(1)]
2. Logarithmic Complexity.[O(logn)]
3. Linear Complexity.[O(n)]
4. Quadratic Complexity.[O(n<sup>c</sup>)]
5. Factorial Complexity.[O(n!)]
6. Exponential Complexity.[O(2<sup>n</sup>)]


To measure complexity there are three step's:-

1. Space Complexity.
2. Time Complexity.
3. Auxiliary Space.
